# WangchanLion

WangchanLion is an instruction-finetuned model based on SEA-LION, a pan-ASEAN pretrained LLM development led by AI Singapore. The finetuning of WangchanLion is a collaborative effort between VISTEC and AI Singapore. 

What WangchanLion offers:
- Transparent pretrained model: The development of SEA-LION is community-driven, with different ASEAN collaborators contributing pretraining datasets. The SEA-LION developers ensure that all datasets are safe and can be utilized without commercial restrictions. This transparency extends to the provision of pretraining code, ensuring anyone can replicate SEA-LION using the provided datasets.
- Transparent finetuning data: In the spirit of open science, we make the finetuning data for WangchanLion accessible to all. This commitment to openness empowers the community by providing complete visibility into the instruction finetuning data that shapes WangchanLion.
- Transparent finetuning code: The finetuning code for WangchanLion is readily available for distribution. By sharing our methods and processes, we invite others to learn from, build upon, and innovate alongside us.
